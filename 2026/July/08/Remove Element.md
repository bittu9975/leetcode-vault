## Problem Statement

Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.

Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:


	Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
	Return k.


Custom Judge:

The judge will test your solution with the following code:


int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int val = ...; // Value to remove
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length.
                            // It is sorted with no values equaling val.

int k = removeElement(nums, val); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
sort(nums, 0, k); // Sort the first k elements of nums
for (int i = 0; i &lt; actualLength; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}


If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.

Example 1:


Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).


Example 2:


Input: nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,4,0,3,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 0, 1, 3, and 4.
Note that the five elements can be returned in any order.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

Constraints:


	0 &lt;= nums.length &lt;= 100
	0 &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 50
	0 &lt;= val &lt;= 100

## Intuition

The problem requires removing all occurrences of a given value from an integer array in-place and returning the number of elements not equal to the given value. The order of elements may be changed. The first k elements of the array should contain the elements which are not equal to the given value.

---

## Optimal Approach

The given solution first sorts the array, then iterates through the array, replacing the given value with Integer.MAX_VALUE. It counts the number of elements not equal to Integer.MAX_VALUE. However, a more efficient approach would be to use a two-pointer technique, where one pointer is used to track the position of the next element that is not equal to the given value, and the other pointer is used to iterate through the array.

## Dry Run

For example, given the array [3,2,2,3] and the value 3, the solution would first sort the array to get [2,2,3,3]. Then, it would replace the 3's with Integer.MAX_VALUE, resulting in [2,2,Integer.MAX_VALUE,Integer.MAX_VALUE]. The count of elements not equal to Integer.MAX_VALUE would be 2.

## Time Complexity

O(n log n)

## Space Complexity

## Important Observations

Sorting, iteration

## Interview Notes

Use two-pointer technique for in-place modification, avoid unnecessary sorting
